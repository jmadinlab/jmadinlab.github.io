- I've been doing science for about 15 years.
- I started off doing science really badly. I still do many things badly. I often forget how to do things I haven't done them for a while (like write a paper or use ggplot). But at very least I've learned that science is just a series of simple equations.  
- There are many books about science, the scientific process, scientific writing, etc, *ad nauseam*.
- But what if someone just showed you some simple equations and their solutions?
- Like a cheat sheet for the scientific process. Short enough that you can read it quickly. If you don't like it, you don't feel like you've wasted any time.
- Also, a living document put together and evolving by using a commonly used scientific versioning tools.
- What better person to start presenting these simple equations than someone who is really slow, someone who took a *really* long time to click scientifically (probably because I never read any of those books mentioned above). Someone who has failed much more than the average scientist, but (here, I'd like to say "wouldn't give up!") honestly had nothing better to do and quite enjoys asking cool questions.
- So, straight to it.  

### Equation 1: the question

- You're here because you have questions to ask--that's not your issue--it's more about how you frame them.
- For a start, a question is usually about something you've noticed. A change in X, for example. X might be temperature, an animal's abundance, the effect of an animal on a plant, the appearance of a new species, and so on.
- If you haven't noticed a change, then it's probably not a good question to ask. A famous scientist once told me that you already know the answer when you pose your question or it wouldn't be a question in the first place. Science is just working out if there's enough evidence to support your answer.
- The crazy thing is about science is that even when  

### Equation 1: collecting the data

- If you don't enjoy this part, choose another study system or occupation.  Nothing more to say.

### Equation 2: the paper

- Don't bother making the formatting look nice, no-one cares. They just want an easy read, something that gets straight to the point.

The scientific paper
- The research question
- The funding proposal

### The bottlenecks

1. The question

You are a scientist because you are curious about the universe. You have more questions than you can address in a lifetime, so you need to choose good questions to pursue. If you can't think of a question, then you should probably choose another occupation. Once you have your question, 

2. The data collection



- The analysis
- The distilation
- The presentation
- The writing
- The journal
- The rejection
- The repeat
- The application
- The outreach
