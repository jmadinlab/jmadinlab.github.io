If you're interesting in joining us as a graduate student, postdoc, technician, or intern, below is some information to help you decide.

### Graduate students

On average, the lab takes on one graduate student each year. Generally, the student needs to bring their own funding for at least three years (e.g., a NOAA fellowship or NSF GRFP). Occasionally, there will be funding available to support a student, but this is rare and will be advertised broadly (e.g., this website, HIMB's website, Coral List, Ecolog and Twitter).

### Postdocs

There is occasionally funding to support a postdoc, which will be advertised broadly. We are more than happy to help people apply for postdoc funding opportunities. Postdocs with their own funding and overlapping research interests are welcome to discuss joining the lab at anytime.

### Interns

Interns will be considered on a rolling basis when space and projects permit. Please consider what it is that you would like to get out of your experience and express this when you contact us (we might not be able to respond to generic requests).

### Visitors

Moku o Loâ€™e (Coconut Island) is a fantastic place for a sabbatical or to conduct coral reef research.  If you'd like to be a visiting researcher associated with the lab, please contact Josh directly.
