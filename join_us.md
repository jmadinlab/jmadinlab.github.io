If you're interesting in joining the Geometric Ecology Lab as a graduate student, postdoc, technician, or intern, below is some information to help you decide.

### Graduate students

On average, the lab takes on one graduate student each year. Students need to bring their own funding for at least two years. Occasionally, there will be funding available to support a student, but this is rare and will be advertised broadly (e.g., this website, HIMB's website, Coral List, Ecolog and Twitter).

Graduate students in the Geometric Ecology Lab develop their own research questions, which means they come to the lab with a vision for what they want to pursue. We are a quantitative ecology lab, and so a solid grounding in mathematics, statistics and coding is a prerequisite. Therefore, when writing about joining the lab, please state both why the lab is a good fit for your vision and describe the research you would like to pursue in specific terms (e.g., specific hypotheses theories you would like to address). Avoid broad statements about saving coral reefs, climate change and habitat restoration without reference to novel scientific questions you would like to pursue. 

Generic emails seeking graduate support may not be answered.

### Postdocs

There is occasionally funding to support a postdoc, which will be advertised broadly. We are more than happy to help people apply for postdoc funding opportunities. Postdocs with their own funding and overlapping research interests are welcome to discuss joining the lab at anytime.

### Interns

Interns will be advertised and considered on a rolling basis when space and projects permit. 

### Visitors

Moku o Loâ€™e (Coconut Island) is a fantastic place for a sabbatical or to conduct coral reef research.  If you'd like to be a visiting researcher associated with the lab, please contact Josh directly.
