### History

*•Current student at Kapi'olani Community College majoring in Biological Sciences (graduating in 2024), on track to transfer into the Marine Biology program at UH Mānoa.*

### Research

My interests lie in the areas of coral classification and conservation. I am passionate about bridging the gap between the western and indigenous sciences surrounding coral reefs, particularly in my home country of Fiji. 
I draw heavily from my family's traditional tribal role as 'gonedau' or fisherpeople and custodians of the ocean.
