### Research

I am interested in anything related to 3D technology, now mostly focusing on the population dynamics of corals and their relationship with morphological traits. I am conducting reefs 3D monitoring projects in Taiwan and willing to share the data. I am also interested in octocoral taxonomy for personal interests.
