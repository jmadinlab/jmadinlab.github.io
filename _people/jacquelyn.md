### History

In 2019, I graduated simultaneously from O’Fallon Township High School and Southwestern Illinois Community College with an Associate’s of Science degree in addition to my high school diploma.  I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s of Science degree in Marine Biology at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa and expect to graduate in May 2022.


### Research

I’m currently working with PhD student, Shreya Yadav, exploring spatial patterns in coral bleaching, recovery, and mortality in Kāne'ohe Bay with photogrammetry. I am interested in just about anything that relates to the ocean, but if I had to pick one particular oceanic interest, I’d say cephalopods.  I’m also very passionate about coral reef conservation.

### Fun Fact

In high school, I dove on a club team with a springboard diver who competed in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics this past summer.
