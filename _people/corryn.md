### Research

I am interested in marine conservation and restoration. I have been involved with research that studies coral and fish associations with various structural complexities of artificial reefs. In the future I hope to utilize ecosystem-based management practices that are informed by traditional Hawaiian resource management practices to help conserve and restore marine ecosystems.
