### History

- *Graduated from HPU undergraduate program majoring in Marine Biology (Fall 2021- Spring 2023)*
- *BFA Art and Design concentration in Photography from California Polytechnic State University (2014-2018)*

### Research

I am interested in marine conservation and restoration. I have been involved with research that studies coral and fish associations with various structural complexities of artificial reefs. In the future I hope to utilize ecosystem-based management practices that are informed by traditional Hawaiian resource management practices to help conserve and restore marine ecosystems.
