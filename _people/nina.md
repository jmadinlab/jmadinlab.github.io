### Research

My main research interests are broadly related to ecosystem functioning. I aim to quantify functions (i.e. the flow of energy and nutrients), understand what drives them, and investigate how they are affected by human-induced change. At the moment, my main research focus is the link between geometrical structures, diversity, and functions.
