### History

I have a BA in Psychology, an MA in Special Education, and am currently working towards a BS in Marine Biology at UH Mānoa.


### Research

I’m currently assisting PhD student, Shreya Yadav, with her research in exploring spatial patterns in coral bleaching, recovery, and mortality using photogrammetry in Kāne‘ohe Bay. In the future I’d love to work in research of elasmobranchs in some capacity.

### Fun Fact

I’m very active and love to surf, dive, dirt bike, mountain bike, and wakeboard.
