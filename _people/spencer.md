### Research

Anything 3D related, but mostly focused on understanding the 3-dimensional structure of coral reef habitats. Currently, I apply structure-from-motion photogrammetry and GIS to learn about the spatial and temporal changes in coral reef structural complexity. I also assist with other lab projects focused on understanding structural complexity in reef habitats.
