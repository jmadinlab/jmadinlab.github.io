### History

*â€¢Current Student at University of Hawai'i at Manoa majoring in Marine Biology with a bachelors in Science and a minor in french (2023 - present)

### Research

I'm interested in environmental ecology and conservation methods, especially those which can maintain or improve threatened ecosystems. 
I don't have much experience in the field yet, but I'm very excited to learn more and help out.
