### Research

Adaptation of corals in warming ocean conditions and resource management actions supported by the biology of coral bleaching are my focal research interests.  I work on projects investigating the efficacy of selective coral propagation for use in reef restoration and the distribution of thermal-tolerance as a trait within coral populations.  I also work on development of novel instrumentation and experimental apparatus combining engineering, programming, and electronics to support coral research.
