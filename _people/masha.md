### History

- In 2019 I graduated from Kauai Community College with an Associates in Science - Biology and a certificate in mathematics.
- Currently attending the University of Hawaii - Manoa where I am on track to graduate December 2021 with a Bachelors of Science in Global Environmental Science and a certificate in Russian studies.

### Research

-  At the moment, I am assisting PhD graduate student Devynn Wulstein at the Joshua Madin Lab in HIMB  in her project where we are investigating if scleractinian corals have a self-thinning relationship.

### Fun Fact

- When I am not focusing on the research or doing school work, I enjoy spending my free time with my friends at the beach or exploring our beautiful little island we call home. I am no stranger to traveling abroad and I hope that when it is safe to do so, I can continue to conquer my quest to see as many wonders of the world as I can.
