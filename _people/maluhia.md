### Research

Aloha mai kāua e, I come from the island of Kauaʻi where I was born and raised in the ahupuaʻa of Anahola. During my time on Moku o Loʻe, 
I will be observing the relationship between coral reef morphology and wave attenuation to better quantify bottom friction in shallow water zones. 
As a kilomoana, the term for a marine scientist in ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi (Hawaiian Language), it is my privilege to blend modern technology and ʻIke Hawaiʻi to offer 
revitalized perspectives and solutions for the future of ocean stewardship.
