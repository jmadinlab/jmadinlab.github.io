### Research

My research explores the impacts of environmental stressors on the growth and morphology of reef-building corals, with a focus on 3D morphometric analyses. I&#39;m interested in how anthropogenic stressors such as microplastics, global warming, and ocean acidification affect coral frameworks and their future in marine ecosystems, as well as how artificial structures can assist in reef restoration to better support reefs facing these stressors.
