### History

*â€¢Hawaii Pacific University B.S. in Biology with Conservation, Ecology, and Evolution Concentration (Fall 2021 - Spring 2025)*

### Research

I have a passion for restoration ecology and after achieving my degree I aim to work towards the restoration of terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems around the world. I have a strong interest in advanced technology and love to be involved in research using the newest inventions for the protection and regeneration of damaged habitats. I love lab work but am extremely excited to increase my experience in the field.
