### Research

My research interests revolve around the use of cutting-edge technological approaches to understanding the hierarchy of mechanisms in reef geometric complexity underlying coral reef biodiversity.  Specifically, I’m interested in quantifying and predicting the structural consequences of climate-associated disturbances and how these cascade along ecological lines affecting the functioning of coral reef ecosystems locally and regionally.
