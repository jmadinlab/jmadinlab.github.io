### Code

Here is the easiest way to create a new lab project, assuming you are using `RStudio` and have `git` installed on your computer.

1. Open `RStudio`
2. Select `File` -> `New Project...`
3. Select `New Directory`, then `New Project`
4. Choose a sensible project name. Think of this as a forever choice (it can be changed, but it's a hassle). Use underscores or CamelCase instead of spaces (e.g., `surface_geometry` or `SurfaceGeometry`). Don't use generic names like `Chapter1`; remember that the whole lab is using this GitHub organization.  If in doubt, consult with another lab member who has experience creating projects.
5. Click `Browse...` to choose a place for the project on your computer
6. Make sure the `Create a git repository` is selected; it should be by default
7. Click `Create Project`
8. Create an `analysis.R` file with `New Script`
9. Create a `README.md` file with `New File`. Make sure the file extension is `.md`
10. Create the following folders with the `New Folder` button (keep lowercase except for the `R` folder):

| Folder | Purpose | Why it's special |
|---|---|---|
|`data`| For raw data only | It is *read only*! Never save or manipulate anything in this folder |
|`R`| For R code that is sourced from the main `analysis.R` script | Reduced clutter in the main analysis script |
|`output`| For saving anything produced by the analysis script (e.g., tables, cleaned datasets, figures, etc.) | The folder can be deleted and regenerated by the analysis script |
|`figs`| This is also an `output` folder, but is often easier to keep separate. For saving figures only | The folder can be deleted and regenerated by the analysis script |
|`doc`| This is for manuscripts and presentations, and typically isn't versioned controlled by adding `doc` to the `.gitignore` | A general folder for stuff |

11. Go to the `Git` top-right panel
12. Looks at the staging list. Is there anything weird in there? (e.g., on a Mac you might get `.DS_Store` files). If so, add these to the `.gitignore` file.
13. Once you're happy, stage everything and click `Commit`. Double check there isn't any junk being committed in the list, write a comment like "first commit!" and click `Commit`

14. Go to [jmadinlab](https://github.com/orgs/jmadinlab)
15. Click the green `New` (repository) button
16. Leave the project as `Private`. Click the green `Create repository` button. (Don't initialize with a README.)
17. Copy the two lines under `...or push an existing repository from the command line`
18. Go back to RStudio and click the cog/settings symbol in the `Git` panel, choose `Shell...`
19. Paste the two lines from the GitHub webpage and press enter.
20. That's it. You'll noticed that the push and pull arrows in the Git panel in RStudio will now be highlighted.
21. Finally, add project collaborators to your project on the GitHub page by going to `Settings`, then `Manage Access` and click the green `Invite teams or people` button.
22. When your research is published, please make the GitHub repository public (under `Settings` -> `Manage Access`) and make sure the link to the repo is published with your paper.

### Datasets

Most datasets are small enough to be published with the GitHub project (above). Some journals require that data are submitted to online data repositories so they have a `DOI`, in which case follow the journal's instructions.

Please also add your data set to the lab's dataset register.
