Joshua Madin, Maria Dornelas (University of St Andrews, Scotland) and fellow collaborators have been making annual visits to LIRS since the early 2000s during which they monitored the changing ecology of coral reef communities.  Their trips coincide with the  annual coral spawning event.  Their long-term and detailed data sets are enormously valuable and are unmatched anywhere in the world.  Most recently, this data captures the impacts on coral communities due to two devastating cyclones (2014, 2015) and two mass coral bleaching events (2016, 2017).  The process of reef recovery from these events is now a major focus of their research.

We are delighted to report that the Charles Warman Foundation, a long term supporter of LIRRF is providing the additional funding required to continue for the next 3 years.
