With the Hawai’i stay-at-home order starting at midnight, and the [recent interest](https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/post/using-coral-colonies-predict-growth-covid-19) in the application of logistic models (that we usually fit to corals) to the outbreak locally, here are some scenarios for the next few weeks:

- **Best case**, 2-week scenario: cases decline to zero during the 2-week stay-at-home order. I guess we could get to zero faster, but unlikely.
- **1-month scenario**: cases decline by halve during the 2-weeks (to around 100 cases per day), but take another 2-weeks to get to zero. This scenario might require an extension of the stay-at-home order.
- **2-month scenario**: cases decline by a quarter in the 2-weeks (still in the mid to high 100s), but take 2 months to get to zero. This is the kind of scenario that might lead to harsher lock-down orders.
- **Status quo**: this is the "do nothing" scenario, which clearly doesn't apply, but good to compare how well Hawai’i does over during the stay-at-home order.

> Note that these are *not* predictions. These scenarios take the data on cases so far, and then ask the 4 *what-ifs* above.
