Through our work on the [Coral Trait Database](https://coraltraits.org), we have been actively involved with developing the [Open Traits Network](https://opentraits.org) (OTN) with collaborators all over the world. The OTN is a global, decentralised community of researchers and institutions who welcomes anyone working towards standardising and integrating trait data across all organisms. We are guided by the principles of Open Science, particularly Open Methods, Open Source and Open Data.

Read about the OTN in this [perspective piece](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41559-020-1109-6).  

Consider becoming a member and registering a trait dataset if you have one ([link](https://opentraits.org)). This dataset registry will enable people to find and integrate traits across the tree of life.
