We are looking to recruiting a 3-year postdoc to develop research focused on quantifying the relationships between coral built structures and ecosystem functions in new and scalable ways using emerging technologies. The research will be in collaboration with Josh Madin (Hawaii), Maria Dornelas (St. Andrews) and Elizabeth Madin (Hawaii). Duties of the postdoc will include:
- Use photogrammetry and laser scanning to better understand the geometry of corals and reef in the field.
- Observe the accumulation of biodiversity (reef fishes, corals, and other invertebrates and algae) on 3D-printed ceramic structures.
- Develop mathematical models using quantitative and reasoning skills.
- Design and lead research experiments investigating the structure and function of coral reefs with a particular emphasis on surface geometry, ecological succession, coexistence, demography, biomechanics and other functional and life history traits of coral reef organisms.
- Develop their own broadly related research questions
- Write manuscripts, reports, and proposals for funding.  
- Present research at scientific conferences.
- Act as a senior laboratory member in overseeing and mentoring senior undergraduate and graduate students.
- Train students in experimental techniques and novel technologies.
- Apply advanced computational tools in a research setting.
- Process,  manipulate, and analyze large datasets.
- Coordinate and lead marine field research.
