We are recruiting a 3-year postdoc to develop research focused on quantifying the relationships between coral built structures and ecosystem functions in new and scalable ways using emerging technologies. The research will be in collaboration with Josh Madin (University of Hawaii), Maria Dornelas (University of St. Andrews) and Elizabeth Madin (University of Hawaii). Duties of the postdoc will include:
- Designing and leading research experiments investigating the structure and function of coral reefs with a particular emphasis on surface geometry, ecological succession, coexistence, demography, biomechanics and other functional and life history traits of coral reef organisms.
- Using photogrammetry and laser scanning to better understand the geometry of corals and reefs in the field.
- Observing and measuring the accumulation of biodiversity (reef fishes, corals, and other invertebrates and algae) on 3D-printed ceramic structures.
- Developing mathematical models using quantitative and reasoning skills.
- Developing their own broadly related research questions.
- Writing manuscripts, reports, and proposals for funding.  
- Presenting research at scientific conferences.
- Acting as a senior laboratory member in overseeing and mentoring senior undergraduate and graduate students.
- Training students in experimental techniques and novel technologies.
- Applying advanced computational tools in a research setting.
- Processing, manipulating, and analyzing large datasets.
- Coordinating and leading marine field research.

There is an official posting on [this website](https://hcmweb.rcuh.com/psc/hcmprd_exapp/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM.HRS_APP_SCHJOB.GBL?FOCUS=Applicant), where you search on the job number *221076*. Please note that the website only shows a minimum salary for the pay range, and that the salary would be higher and consistent with other postdocs at HIMB.

To apply, please follow the instructions at the official website. Application materials are:

1. A cover Letter explaining your motivation for applying for this position, how your prior research experience qualifies you for the position, how you satisfy the required and desirable qualifications, and your career goals.
2. Your CV.
3. The names and contact details for three references.
4. A short 1-2 page research proposal describing independent research you would like to undertake.
5. They ask for transcripts, but you can consider these optional, perhaps if you want to demonstrate mathematical or statistical skills. Proof of PhD will eventually be required for the successful applicant.

**CLOSING DATE: March 24, 2021**

Any questions to [Josh Madin](mailto:jmadin@hawaii.edu).
