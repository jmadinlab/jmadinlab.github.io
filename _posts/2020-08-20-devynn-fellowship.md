We are very excited to announce that [Devynn Wulstein](/people/devynn) has been awarded a [National Marine Fisheries Service-Sea Grant Joint Fellowship](https://seagrant.noaa.gov/NMFS-SG-Fellowship).  Devynn will be working on developing an analytical pipeline for broadscale decision-making on coral reefs using Structure-from-Motion to benthic population models. (Put more simply, Devynn will magically turn photos of the reef into metrics of coral population health and apply this magic to NOAA sites across the Pacific.)
