The Geometric Ecology Lab at the Hawai’i Institute of Marine Biology is looking for two highly
motivated undergraduate students to help advance ongoing projects. Experience with marine
ecology/biology and any specific technique mentioned below is appreciated but not required.
Enthusiasm and motivation to learn about coral reef fishes or coral restoration are key!

### Position 1: Fish Video Analysis

Do you have a passion for coral reef fishes and can’t get enough of watching them? Then this
internship is for you. The primary goal will be to analyze videos from reefs in Kaneohe Bay to
understand the link between the structure of the reef and fish diversity and functioning. Tasks
include video analysis, data entry, occasional field work, and helping with various projects in the
lab. We are looking for someone who is detail-oriented, has some experience with data entry, is
organized, able to work independently, curious, and kind. Experiences in video analysis, fish
identification, and marine field work are a plus.

**Application closing date**: 03/14/2025  
**Ideal start date**: 03/24/2025  
**Work hours**: Flexible, 8-20 hrs/week  

Send CV and cover letter to Nina Schiettekatte (ninamds@hawaii.edu)  

### Position 2: Artificial Reef Construction and Monitoring

Are you interested in Hawaiian corals and reef restoration? The Geometric Ecology Lab at the
Hawaiʻi Institute of Marine Biology (HIMB) is looking for an undergraduate student who is detail-
oriented, flexible, driven, capable, and independent. The purpose of this project is to determine
what shape combinations (module and coral morphology) result in greatest success (fusion, growth,
and survival) for coral micro-fragments.

Duties: Learning how to operate a large-scale 3D printer, create silicon molds, mix/cast concrete,
collect and fragment coral colonies, and snorkel to assist in deploying and monitoring artificial reef
structures. Training will be provided where necessary. Experience and/or familiarity with the
aforementioned duties are preferred, but not required.

Requirements: Reliable transport to and from HIMB, ability safely to lift 60lbs, and be comfortable
with snorkeling/breath holds for module deployments/monitoring.

**Application closing date**: 03/14/2025  
**Ideal start date**: 03/24/2025  
**Work hours**: Flexible, 10-20 hrs/week  

Send CV and cover letter to Jon Ehrenberg (jgke@hawaii.edu)
