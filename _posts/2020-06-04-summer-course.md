### Applying Innovative Technologies in Marine Science

*Dates:* August 31st to September 25th, 2020  
*Format:* 4-week intensive, on-site summer program  
*Participants:* 16 maximum  
*Cost:* All costs are covered (course fees, accommodation, subsistence food, and reasonable travel costs)  
*Instructors:*  
- Lars Bejder ([www.mmrphawaii.org](https://www.mmrphawaii.org))
- Elizabeth Madin ([www.oceansphere.org](https://www.oceansphere.org))
- Joshua Madin ([jmadinlab.github.io](https://jmadinlab.github.io))

The goal of this course is to introduce participants to innovative technologies and their uses in the field of marine science. The course will be open to incoming graduate students, graduate students, postdocs, and other early-career researchers. The course will leverage the exceptional research capacities, facilities, and location of HIMB and Moku o Lo’e (Coconut Island) to advance scientific and career goals of participants who otherwise may not have this unique opportunity. The course will include lectures, hands-on field work, a lab component, and data analysis for projects developed during the program. The course will provide an introduction to the fundamentals of conducting robust science, including open and reproducible science, science communication beyond academia to diverse stakeholder groups, and more. Included in the course will be a statistical programming module and guest lectures by scientists, conservation practitioners, and managers using cutting-edge technology. Participants will gain hands-on exposure to a range of technologies and tools relevant to the instructors’ and guest instructors’ research portfolios (e.g., unoccupied aerial systems, above-water and underwater photogrammetry, remote sensing imagery, 3D laser scanning and printing, and more). Broadening participants’ exposure to new and emerging technologies will provide them a foundation upon which to incorporate these technologies into their scientific and career goals.
