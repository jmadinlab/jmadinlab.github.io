Our NSF proposal about habitat geometry and biodiversity was successfully funded. The project will support our ongoing research about the geometry of ecosystems, while allowing us to run several important experiments and bring on a team of postdocs, PhDs and undergraduates.  The project is co-run with [Liz Madin](https://www.oceansphere.org) and [Maria Dornelas](https://synergy.st-andrews.ac.uk/diversity/dr-maria-dornelas/) at St Andrew. The NSF-NERC agreement means that Maria also gets a good chunk of NERC funding. (So something to consider if you collaborate closely with someone in the UK.)
