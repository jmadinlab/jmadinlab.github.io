We are recruiting two 3-5-year postdocs to develop research focused on quantifying and fabricating 3D habitats. The postdocs will be based at the Hawai‘i Institute of Marine Biology in the laboratory of Dr. Joshua Madin (jmadinlab.github.io). HIMB is an organized research unit within the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST; www.soest.hawaii.edu) at the University of Hawai‘i at Manoa. HIMB provides unparalleled research opportunities, in particular due to its unique location on Moku o Lo‘e Island (Coconut Island) surrounded by the coral reefs of Kane‘ohe Bay on the windward side of the island of O‘ahu (~ 24 km from the main university campus in Manoa).

The PI’s lab offer a supportive and stimulating research environment with a group of highly collegial scientists who are committed to scientific outreach, to open science, and to enhancing diversity in STEM. The postdocs will be part of a large interdisciplinary team from both academia and industry tasked with developing new techniques to reduce wave energy through the construction of hybrid coral reefs. The postdocs will work closely with (i) engineers developing base structures designed to attenuate waves upon which 3D surface structures will be attached; (ii) molecular biologists developing surface biopolymers that promote or inhibit growth of various benthic taxa on surface structures; and (iii) ecologists optimizing micro-fragmentation of resilient corals for embedding within surface structures. This is a phased project with up to five (5) years of continuous post-doctoral funding providing the agency benchmarks are met at eighteen (18) and thirty-six (36) months.

The postdocs will be given plenty of freedom to develop their own research questions, not necessarily related to the broader project. However, they will be required to develop novel research focused in part on quantifying the relationships between coral and artificial structures and ecosystem functions in new and scalable ways using emerging technologies. They will write manuscripts, reports, and proposals for funding.  They will present research at scientific conferences. Importantly, they will act as a senior laboratory member in overseeing and mentoring senior undergraduate and graduate students. They will be required to coordinate and lead marine experiments and field research.

The official posting is [here](https://hcmweb521.rcuh.com/psp/hcmprd_exapp/EMPLOYEE/HRMS/c/HRS_HRAM.HRS_APP_SCHJOB.GBL?Page=HRS_APP_JBPST&Action=U&FOCUS=Applicant&SiteId=3&JobOpeningId=222296&PostingSeq=1
) (search on job number *222296* if it doesn't display correctly). Please note that the website only shows a minimum salary for the pay range, and that the salary would be higher and consistent with other postdocs at HIMB (~$65k per year). 

To apply, please follow the instructions at the official website. Application materials are:

1. A cover Letter explaining your motivation for applying for this position, how your prior research experience qualifies you for the position, how you satisfy the required and desirable qualifications, and your career goals.
2. Your CV.
3. The names and contact details for three references.
4. A short 1-2 page research proposal describing independent research you would like to undertake.
5. They ask for transcripts, but you can consider these optional, perhaps if you want to demonstrate mathematical or statistical skills. Proof of PhD will eventually be required for the successful applicant.

**APPLICATION CLOSING DATE: May 16, 2022**

> Ideally the postdoc to start in time for the next coral spawning (May/June 2022).

Any questions to [Josh Madin](mailto:jmadin@hawaii.edu).
